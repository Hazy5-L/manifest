Welcome to Hazy-Legacy
===================


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Hazy-L, you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

Please take note that we have two main line branches depending on
which hardware base your phone is working.

To initialize your local repository using the AOSPB trees, use this command:


	repo init -u git://github.com/hazy5-L/manifest.git -b mm6.0



Then sync up with this command:

	repo sync
